# Pipeline — how work moves

Five kinds of work. Each has its own path; only one goes through design. Everything that isn't listed here is one of these five, or it's a decision (`DECISIONS.md`).

| Kind | What it is | Opened by | Approval | Tracked as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scenario** | New feature or behavior a person experiences | Cowork, from IMAGINE or Don | Cowork approves the scenario; Don rules only on scope or a contested call | `planning/scenario-*.md` → Issues labeled `scenario` |
| **Change** | UX/UI polish, copy, layout, a small tweak to existing behavior | Anyone | User-facing copy: Don ([public-is-draft]). Otherwise none | Issue labeled `change` |
| **Bug** | Something built doesn't do what its scenario or the code intends | Anyone | None. `launch-blocking` label if it is | Issue labeled `bug` |
| **Process** | A change to this repo's structure, rules, or lint — or to a skill in `~/Projects/skills` | Cowork, Code or Don | Must name the failure with a dated example (`LESSONS.md`) | A PR in the repo that owns the file + a line in `LESSONS.md`. Cowork merges |
| **Chore** | Dependencies, config, deploy, tooling — nothing a member sees | Code | None unless it touches production ([production-asks-don]) | Issue labeled `chore` |

## Paths

- **Scenario:** `IMAGINE.md` → `planning/scenario-*.md` (draft) → Cowork review flips it to approved → Code opens an Issue with the architecture note and builds → all acceptance checks closed → `sync` deletes the scenario.
- **Change / Bug / Chore:** Issue → Code builds → PR closes it. No scenario, no handoff, no review file. Don sees a preview link, not a document.
- **Process:** name the failure, make the change on a branch, open the PR, log it. Cowork merges. Small fixes any time. A reorganisation of the tree is rare, in one session, with a git tag first.

## Rules of the road (guidelines)

- Anyone may open an Issue in `socialus-web`, including Cowork via Dispatch. Only Code commits code there.
- A scenario's **spec** is ≤40 lines across three sections: Story, Acceptance, Not this. If the spec needs more, it's two scenarios.
- A fourth section, **Why**, carries rationale — why this shape, what was rejected, how it relates to a neighbouring scenario. **It is not counted toward the 40 lines**, because the cap exists to keep a spec small enough to hold in your head and rationale is not spec. *(Added 2026-09-17: 12 of 37 scenarios already carried exactly this content under a dozen ad-hoc headings, which is what kept `scripts/lint.sh` red. Deleting it to satisfy a linter would have destroyed the reasoning behind ratified decisions; giving it one name makes it checkable.)*
- If a Change starts needing acceptance checks, it's a Scenario. If a Bug fix changes what a scenario promises, it's a Change to the scenario first.
- Launch-blocking work displaces everything else. When a new launch-blocker lands, `sync` names what moved to Next.
- When something arrives that fits none of the five, don't force it — log it in `LESSONS.md` as a gap and pick the nearest path for now.

## Verified or not

A claim that something works is worth what the check behind it was worth. So say which check ran.

- **Every PR states how it was verified**, in one line: `live DB`, `local Postgres`, `unit tests only`, or `not verified`. Security and migration work must say it; everything else should.
- **Unverified work opens as a draft PR**, with the missing check named at the top of the body and what would clear it. Ready-for-review means the check ran.
- "Tests pass" from a laptop is `unit tests only` until CI says otherwise. There is no test workflow yet — see `LESSONS.md` 19.

## Who checks what

**Agents own whether a change is correct. Don owns whether it is right.** Correct is testable — it compiles, the tests pass, the migration applies, the rule is enforced. Right is a judgment about the product, and no test has an opinion about it.

Don does not read code, and nothing should ever ask him to. What he looks at is the running app on the preview link.

**He looks when the change:**

- alters anything a person sees or does — a screen, a control, copy, an image, an empty state
- adds a capability for the first time, rather than extending one that already exists
- touches privacy, money, or public visibility (the address-is-public copy is the type case)
- has an acceptance criterion containing a judgment word — *clear*, *easy*, *minimal fumbling*. Those are the words only he can score
- came back with a deviation, or a judgment call the agent had to make on his behalf

**He does not look at:** migrations with no visible effect, tests, refactors, docs, infrastructure, dependency bumps.

### The mechanism

Every PR opens with one of exactly two things, before anything else in the body:

1. **"Don doesn't need to look."** — and one line saying why not.
2. **The preview link, three numbered steps, and what he should expect to see.** Label the PR `needs-don`.

The steps are written for someone holding a phone who has not read the ticket: *"Open the link, tap Create, choose Business."* Not *"navigate to the composer route."* No file paths, no function names, no ticket numbers, no jargon.

**If a change cannot be described that way, that is a signal it needs his eyes more, not less.** Say so in the PR and label it anyway — an agent that cannot explain a change in three plain steps has found something worth his attention, not an excuse to skip him.

### When he merges without looking

Nothing blocks it, and nothing should — his plan has no protection rules, and a gate he can't bypass on his own repo is worse than the problem. Instead the `needs-don` label **stays on after merge**, so `is:merged label:needs-don` is the list of things that shipped without his eyes. It is a list to review, not an alarm.

## Accepted risk

A lint finding ruled acceptable gets recorded once and stops being re-argued. The ruling is the dated line in `DECISIONS.md`; `accepted-risks/` holds one JSON file per finding so an advisor run can be diffed against it — `bash scripts/advisor-diff.sh <export.json>` prints only what isn't already ruled on, plus anything past review.

- One file per finding, named for the finding (`<cache_key>.json`, else `<lint>__<object>.json`). Two agents ruling the same thing collide on the filename instead of writing two rulings.
- An entry needs a `decision` (the `DECISIONS.md` date it points at), a `revisit_if` (the observable condition that reopens it), a `review_by` date, and an `owner` — who argues it again. **`scripts/lint.sh` fails the day `review_by` passes**: an accepted risk nobody revisits is an inert guard.
- `revisit_if` is a fact about the world, not a feeling — "the view's WHERE clause changes", not "if we get worried".
- A past `review_by` is reported on every run. An entry nobody will re-argue is deleted, not renewed silently; renewing it is a new dated line.
- Never derive a `cache_key` from the naming pattern. A key that looks right but never matches stops suppressing silently; `null` falls back to `(lint, object)` and keeps working.

## Open questions

A question nobody has answered yet is marked **inline, where it was raised**, and nowhere else. There is no register — `DECISIONS.md` § Open was one, and on 2026-09-27 F080's detection question stood in it, in F080 and in #221 at once. **The index is generated**: `STATUS.md` § Open questions, by `python3 scripts/markers.py index`.

**The marker — copy this, without the backticks:**

`[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-27] Where is a picture of a child detected — review before visible, or the uploader's word?`

- **`owner`** is who must answer: `don`, `cowork` or `code`. Not who asked.
- **`raised`** is the date it was first asked, never updated. The index sorts oldest first and shows the age, so a stale question is visible without anyone tending it.
- **The question follows on the same line.** Options, trade-offs and a recommendation go in the lines after it, as before — A/B/C, one line each.
- In a code or migration comment the marker follows the comment token: `-- [open-question owner=code raised=2026-09-27] …`.
- In backticks it is a mention, not a marker — which is how this section quotes it.

**Where it goes — one rule: in the file the answer will change.**

- The answer changes what a member experiences → **the scenario**, in `## Why`. No scenario yet → the spine entry in `product/`.
- The answer changes only how it is built → **the Issue body** in `socialus-web`. Code owns it.
- The answer changes one line of code or one migration and nothing above it → **a comment on that line**.
- **Never** in a PR description, a commit message or an Issue comment: none is scanned, and a merged PR or a commit cannot be edited, so the marker could never be closed. **Never** in `DECISIONS.md`, which holds answers. An Issue that restates a scenario's question points at the scenario instead.

**Who writes one.** Whoever raises a question they cannot answer and will not answer this session — Cowork in `plan` and `review`, Code in `ticket` and `build`. An agent that would otherwise write *"open"*, *"TBD"* or *"needs a ruling"* writes the marker.

**What closes one.**

- **`owner=don`:** the answer is a ruling, so it lands as a dated `DECISIONS.md` line first ([ruling-is-dated-line]). **The same commit** removes the marker and edits the text the answer changes. Whoever records the ruling removes the marker — Cowork, or Code when the ruling reached an Issue.
- **`owner=cowork` / `owner=code`:** the answer is the change itself. The commit that makes it removes the marker and says so in its message. A `DECISIONS.md` line only if it settles something that would otherwise be re-argued.
- **A marker is never deleted without an answer.** A question that became moot is closed by a commit message saying why. A scenario or Issue carrying a marker is not deleted or closed until the marker is answered or moved.

**What checks it.** `scripts/lint.sh` fails on a marker missing an owner, a date or a question, or sitting in `DECISIONS.md` — and first proves the checker rejects every line of its bad fixtures in `scripts/fixtures/markers/` ([guard-proves-itself]). The same checker runs the other markers — `process/LIVING-DOCS.md` § Grep-built, never hand-kept. It runs in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. `socialus-web` runs the same grammar in its own CI for code comments. Issue bodies are not gated; a malformed marker there is listed in the index as malformed.
